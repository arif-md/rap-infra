## Deployment Strategy: Three-Environment Approach

### Environment Progression
```
Development → Testing → Production
     ↓            ↓         ↓
   Dev ACR    Test ACR   Prod ACR
     ↓            ↓         ↓
  Dev Apps    Test Apps  Prod Apps
```

### Quality Gates
- **Development**: Rapid iteration and testing
- **Testing**: Quality assurance and performance validation  
- **Production**: Stable, monitored production releases

### Image Promotion
- **Immutable Containers**: Same tested image promoted across environments
- **Automated Pipeline**: GitHub Actions orchestrate the promotion
- **Rollback Capability**: Quick revert to previous versions if needed

---

## Key Technology Components

### Frontend: Angular Application
- **Modern Web Framework** - Responsive, fast user interface
- **Container Deployment** - Consistent across all environments
- **Version Display** - Built-in version tracking for support

### Backend: Azure Functions
- **Serverless Computing** - Pay only for actual usage
- **Auto-scaling** - Handles traffic spikes automatically
- **Event-driven** - Efficient processing of business logic

### Platform: Azure Container Apps
- **Managed Kubernetes** - Enterprise-grade orchestration without complexity
- **Built-in Security** - HTTPS, network isolation, identity management
- **Monitoring** - Application Insights integration for performance tracking

---

## Development Workflow

### Developer Experience
```
1. Code Change → 2. Git Commit → 3. Automated Build → 4. Deploy to Dev
                                         ↓
5. Quality Testing → 6. Promote to Test → 7. Production Release
```

### Automation Benefits
- **Reduced Manual Errors** - Automated testing and deployment
- **Faster Releases** - From hours to minutes
- **Consistent Environments** - Same configuration across dev/test/prod
- **Audit Trail** - Complete history of changes and deployments

---

## Infrastructure as Code

### Azure Developer CLI (azd)
- **One-Command Deployment** - `azd up` creates entire environment
- **Environment Management** - Easy switching between dev/test/prod
- **Resource Cleanup** - `azd down` removes resources to save costs

### Bicep Templates
- **Declarative Infrastructure** - Infrastructure defined as code
- **Version Control** - Infrastructure changes tracked with application code
- **Reusable Components** - Consistent patterns across projects

### GitHub Actions
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated build, test, and deployment
- **Multi-Service Coordination** - Frontend and backend deployed independently
- **Approval Gates** - Manual approval for production deployments

---

## Cost and Security Benefits

### Cost Optimization
- **Pay-per-Use** - Azure Functions charge only for execution time
- **Auto-scaling** - Resources scale down during low usage
- **Shared Infrastructure** - Container Apps environment shared across services
- **Development Efficiency** - Faster development cycles reduce overall project costs

### Security Features
- **Managed Identity** - No passwords or connection strings in code
- **Network Isolation** - Backend services not exposed to internet
- **SSL by Default** - All communications encrypted
- **Azure Key Vault** - Centralized secret management
- **Role-based Access** - Principle of least privilege access
