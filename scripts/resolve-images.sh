#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Pre-provision hook: Resolve container images from ACR or fallback to public images
# This ensures azd up works even if the configured image digest is stale/missing
#
# BEHAVIOR:
#   - If image is already set with a valid digest, keeps it (workflow-configured images)
#   - If image is missing or invalid, queries ACR for latest
#   - Falls back to public image if ACR repository is empty
#
# This script is used by BOTH:
#   - Local azd up (resolves latest image automatically)
#   - GitHub Actions workflows (keeps workflow-set images, resolves only if missing)
